## Project Description
The main deliverable of this project is a Tableau dashboard based on the provided dataset found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.nardone/viz/OCPRFacilitiesRevenueDashboard/Dashboard1). This included data on daily revenue, daily use, and weather. The dashboard summarizes revenue and use data over time.

Also included are a few Jupyter notebooks. 1-data-cleaning.ipynb was used to check and reshape the provided dataset into a more useable form. 2-data-eda.ipynb was used for rough data plotting for brief exploratory analysis. 3-weather-analysis.ipynb includes a very brief statistical analysis of the effects of weather on revenue. These notebooks were also rendered to HTML using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) so that code and outputs can be viewed easily in a browser without need to install Jupyter.
