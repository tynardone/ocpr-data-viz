# ocpr-data-viz
Data analysis and visualization project for hiring process of OCPR Parks Data Analyst postion.


# Assumptions Being Made:
# 1. Data is simulated and not real data given that it includes dates in the future and is being provided
# to multiple candidates
# 2. Data may be randomly generated with not underlying correlations, and man purpose is to demonstrate data handling
# and visualiztion skills and so primary focuse for this project. Given time constraints the 
# primarty focus will be on the presentation of summary statistcs and trend visualizations as opposed to statistical modeling.
# 3. Golf course rounds played may not be the same as number of visitors. So to avoid any apples to oranges comparisons with
# campers and waterpark visitor numbers we will separatge this and make a Tableau dashboard that is for revenue only.
# 4. If there is more time will perform individual EDA for each facility type in Python, and present each separatlely.
